## Downloding data:
To run thees programs you need to downlode the EMNIST dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist

## Description of programs

**SMV_emnist.py** 

Loads the EMNIST data and trains using Scikit-learn's support vector machine with polynomial kernal. 

**Keras_emnist.py**

Loads the EMNIST data and trains using a Keras convolution neural network. Saves the architecture and weights of the system.

**load_conv.py**

Loads the configuration from *Keras_emnist.py* and makes figures based on the results of the test data.
